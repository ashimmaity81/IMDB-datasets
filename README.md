# IMDB-datasets
This project involved analyzing and visualizing the IMDB movie dataset using tools like Excel to uncover trends and insights in the film industry. The process began with extensive data cleaning, where duplicate entries were removed, missing values were handled, and categorical data was standardized for consistency. Following this, data exploration was carried out to identify patterns in movie ratings, genres, popularity, runtime, and release years. Visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts were created to make the data more understandable and interactive. Key insights included identifying top-rated movies, average ratings over time, genre-wise performance, and budget vs. gross earnings analysis. This project not only improved technical skills in Excel and data storytelling but also demonstrated how structured data analysis can assist producers, directors, and viewers in making informed decisions. Overall, the IMDB dataset project serves as a practical application of data science principles, emphasizing the importance of clean data, exploration, and visual impact.
